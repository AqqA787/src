                <h2>Erling Haaland is on course to shatter Premier League scoring record after netting 20th goal in just
                    15 matches</h2>
                <p>
                    It would seem that not even going six weeks without playing competitive football can knock Erling
                    Haaland out of his stride.

                    The Norwegian goal machine has already scored three times in two matches since English domestic
                    football returned following the World Cup, including his 19th and 20th goals of the Premier League
                    season in Manchester City’s 3-1 win over Leeds United on Wednesday.

                    Haaland has reached the 20-goal mark in just 15 games, meaning he is on course to obliterate the
                    current Premier League scoring record of 34 held jointly by Alan Shearer and Andy Cole. However,
                    that joint record came when there were 42 games played during a season

                    Sao Paulo, Brazil
                    CNN
                    —
                    Pelé, the Brazilian soccer legend who won three World Cups and became the sport’s first global icon,
                    has died at the age of 82.

                    “Everything that we are, is thanks to you,” his daughter Kely Nascimento wrote in a post on
                    Instagram, under an image of family members holding Pele’s hands. “We love you infinitely. Rest in
                    peace.

                <p>
                    The nation's most-capped male player and record men's goalscorer announced his decision on social
                    media.

                    Bale, a five-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, is arguably Wales' finest ever
                    footballer.

                    "After careful and thoughtful consideration, I announce my immediate retirement from club and
                    international football," Bale said.

                    "I feel incredibly fortunate to have realised my dream of playing the sport I love.

                <h2>The US ski resorts built by WW2 soldiers</h2>
                <p>
                    Located 100 miles west of Denver, the Colorado ski town of Vail is set in a bowl-like valley beneath
                    the surrounding mountains, with cobblestone streets and overflowing flower boxes that wouldn't look
                    out of place in an Alpine village. Today, the town's slopes attract hundreds of thousands of skiers
                    every year to what many consider to be the US' quintessential ski resort. But few know that were it
                    not for veterans of a World War Two mountain warfare division, this town – and many others like it
                    across the country – may never have existed.

                    hief executive officer. Marketing director. Lead writer. Sales associate. Job titles like these have
                    generally been standard across work for years. They’re succinct and clear, communicating essential
                    employee details such as job function and seniority. They make sense to employees and recruiters
                    alike, leaving little room for ambiguity.

                <p>
                    There is a new order emerging in space - a race between America and China. But with the demands of
                    space exploration, even these great superpowers won't be able to do it alone.

                    Hugely technically challenging and costly goals have been touted, not least the aim of people living
                    and working on other worlds, possibly within ten years - but in a divided world where international
                    good will is scarce, are they realistic?
